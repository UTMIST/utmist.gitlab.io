# utmist.gitlab.io

Club website for the [University of Toronto Machine Intelligence Student Team (UTMIST)](https://utmist.gitlab.io).

[![pipeline status](https://gitlab.com/utmist/utmist.gitlab.io/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/utmist/utmist.gitlab.io/-/commits/master)

## Overview

- [Google Sheets](https://developers.google.com/sheets) and [Microsoft OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com/) serve as databases.
- The `fetcher` package pulls from [Google Sheets](https://developers.google.com/sheets) and populates **Associate/Department** objects.
- The `generator` package uses the objects fetched to generate **markdown** content pages.
- `onedeath downloads a folder of custom pages (written manually by club associates) from [Microsoft OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com/).
- **Hugo** generates the static site website locally or with **GitLab Pages**.

### Connections

- The `fetcher`/`generator`, `onedeath` and Hugo are run in [GitLab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/ci/) and fed into [GitLab Pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/project/pages/).
- The [UTMIST Runner (MISTR)](https://gitlab.com/utmist/mistr) can trigger a job to regenerate when responding to commands in our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/88mSPw8). If MISTR is offline, jobs must be triggered manually through the [GitLab CI/CD Pipeline Manager](https://gitlab.com/utmist/utmist.gitlab.io/pipelines).

### Prerequisites

- [Go](https://golang.org/). Put this project in `$GOPATH/utmist/`.
- [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases), `>= 0.61`.
- [Lua](https://www.lua.org/).
- [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/).

### GitLab

- We use GitLab CI and GitLab Pages to host this website.
  - GitLab CI has its own environment registry.

  ```

- Paste the environment variables into `.env`. Refer to `.env.copy` for the required variables.
- Run the `fetcher/generator` script.

  ```sh
