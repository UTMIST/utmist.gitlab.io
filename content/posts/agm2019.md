Come and meet the new executive team in **BA1170** at **6PM** on **Monday Sept 16**! We will be talking about a variety of events that will be held throughout the year. At the end of the AGM, project leads will be introducing new academic projects. They will meet with anyone interested in joining the project teams afterwards. Anyone interested in applying for a project associate position is strongly encouraged to come and potentially find your team.
